1. "What is your Project Title?"
2. "What is your Project Description?"
3. "What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running."
4. "Provide instructions and examples for use."
5. "Please select a license"
6. "If you would like contribution from other developers, please add guidelines on what they will need to follow or how to do so."
7. "Write some tests for your application (If Applicable)"

After the user answers these questions in the command-line, a README file will be generated with the following:
